PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

This project is written in C and primarily uses headers from the C Standard Library. No external libraries are strictly required beyond the compiler and the standard runtime.

1. Compiler

- Any ANSI C-compliant compiler is suitable.
- COMPILER = GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang

2. Required Standard C Libraries (Header Files)

- These files must be available in the standard compiler path.
- They provide essential utilities for file handling, random numbers, and boolean logic.

	HEADER_1 = stdio.h      | Standard Input/Output (for printf, fopen, fprintf)
	HEADER_2 = stdlib.h     | Standard Library (for general utilities like malloc, exit, and rand)
	HEADER_3 = time.h       | Time Utilities (for seeding the random number generator using time(0))
	HEADER_4 = stdbool.h    | Boolean Support (for using 'bool' type, 'true', and 'false')

3. Terminal/Environment Requirements (For Colors)

- The 'printMaze' function uses ANSI escape codes for coloring the output. 
- This requires a modern terminal emulator.

TERMINAL_SUPPORT = ANSI Escape Codes
Works best in Linux/macOS terminal, VS Code terminal, or Windows PowerShell. May not display colors correctly in older Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe).

4. Input/Output Files

- These files are used by the program for I/O operations.
- OUTPUT_FILE = generated_maze.txt  
- Created by the program to save the random maze layout.
